# `raw-data/` directory

holds raw data from the experiments that are used to estimate the frequency of resistant parasites and inform the stochastic simulations of experiments.

Files:

-   `Data-information.xlsx` contains information on the different experimental settings to be used for the stochastic simulations of experiments.
-   `NSG-data.xlsx` contains data of the NSG mouse experiments, the data from 2019 were published in [1], all data obtained using the same protocol as described in [1, 2, 3].
-   `Regrowth-3D7-data.xlsx` contains data of the *in vitro* regrowth experiments of 3D7 parasites, the data are published in this work.
-   `Regrowth-field-data.csv` contains data of the *in vitro* regrowth experiments of field isolates, the data are published in this work.
-   `VIS-data.xlsx` contains data from the Volunteer Infection Study (VIS), the data were published in [4].
