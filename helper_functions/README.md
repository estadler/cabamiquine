# `helper_functions/` directory

holds any custom functions used throughout the project

Files:

- `deterministic-model-functions.R` contains the functions for the deterministic model of the frequency of resistant mutants by generation
- `estimates-from-data-helpers.R` functions to help with the estimation of the frequency of resistant mutants from the data
- `general-helper-functions.R` general useful functions
- `stochastic-model-functions.R` contains the functions for the stochastic model of the frequency of resistant mutants
